Instructions and description for the cipher from

There are several ways to create the key table.  This program will fill rows left-to-right, top row to bottom row.  This program will (in this first version) fill the table dropping the letter Q (may have a combine-I-and-J option later).

Encode method
    Create key table
    Break message into digraphs
    Replace Q's with X's (table created with no Q space)
    Insert X's between two same letters
    Add X to end if string has odd number of letters
    Encode
    Print

Encode Rules
    Same row: shift 1 right (wrap if needed)
    Same column: shift 1 down (wrap if needed)
    Otherwise: pick opposite corners of 'box' formed by rows and columns
        higher row's letter first

Decode method
    Create key table
    Break message into digraphs
    Decode (opposite of encode rules, shifts left and up)
    Print (will include any spare X's)
